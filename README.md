# bartleby

A proto-typical TODO application.

Obviously, the name comes after [Bartleby the scrivener](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bartleby_the_Scrivener).
If you're wondering *why*, then you should refuse to do any more work and read that short story first.
It's better to know Bartleby than the Curry-Howard isomorphism.
